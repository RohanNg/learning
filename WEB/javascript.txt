closure - like a environment

        why: data hiding, encapsulation (properties associated with OOP)

        what: associate some data (the environment) with a function that operates on that data

        example:
                function makeAdder(x) {
                  return function(y) {
                    return x + y;
                  };
                }

module pattern: anonymous closure

Every object has a __proto__ object property (except Object); every function has a prototype object property
